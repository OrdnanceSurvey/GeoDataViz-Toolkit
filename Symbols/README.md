## GeoDataViz Toolkit - Symbols

Symbols help us to include lots of detail on maps.

Maps often contain symbols instead of words to label real-life features and make the maps clearer. With so many features on a map, there would not be enough space to write everything down in words.

Symbols can be small pictures, letters, lines or coloured areas to show features like campsites, pubs or bus stations. If you look closely at a map, you will see that it is covered in symbols. There will often be a legend (or key) next to the map to tell you what the symbols mean.

## GeoDataViz Symbols

This set of symbols has been selected to cover a good range of use cases. If you would like to request a symbol for inclusion then please do so by raising an issue on this repository for our consideration.

_You can view and download the SVGs from this repository._
