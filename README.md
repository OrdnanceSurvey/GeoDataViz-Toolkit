## GeoDataViz Toolkit

_Definition of GeoDataViz: Geographic data visualisation – the design process of turning data concerned with physical, human, or location-based geography into a compelling story or argument; or at the very least a clear visual presentation of information._

_Definition of a toolkit: A set of tools, especially one kept in a bag or box and used for a particular purpose._

The GeoDataViz Toolkit is a set of resources that will help you communicate your data effectively through the design of compelling visuals.

In this repository we are sharing resources, assets and other useful links.

## Basemaps

Often referred to as a contextual or backdrop map, a basemap contains reference information used to both orient the map and add context to any data that is overlaid.

_In [this folder](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/GeoDataViz-Toolkit/tree/master/Basemaps) you will find information about the OS range of basemap styles, the colour values for each and some additional information._

## Colours

The use of colour is very often fundamental to the success of a data visualisation. Colour can help with many elements of your design from improving visual contrast to simply catching the eye. Careful use of colour enhances clarity, aids storytelling and draws a viewer into your dataset. Poor use of colour can obscure data, or even mislead.

_In [this folder](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/GeoDataViz-Toolkit/tree/master/Colours) you will find a recommended set of colour palettes, information on how to apply colour to your visualisations and links to other useful colour resources._

## Symbols

Symbols help us to include lots of detail on maps.

Maps often contain symbols instead of words to label real-life features and make the maps clearer. With so many features on a map, there would not be enough space to write everything down in words.

Symbols can be small pictures, letters, lines or coloured areas to show features like campsites, pubs or bus stations. If you look closely at a map, you will see that it is covered in symbols. There will often be a legend (or key) next to the map to tell you what the symbols mean.

_In [this folder](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/GeoDataViz-Toolkit/tree/master/Symbols) you will find a set of Ordnance Survey map symbols, information on how to use symbols effectively and links to other useful map symbol resources._

## Workshops

A workshop is a meeting at which a group of people engage in discussion and activity on a particular topic. We often host workshops at different events and we want to use the GeoDataViz Toolkit to share them more broadly. The topics usually focus on a particular aspect of cartography or data visualisation.

_In [this folder](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/GeoDataViz-Toolkit/tree/master/Workshops) you will find our workshops which include step-by-step workbooks and data._

## Cartographic Design Principles

Inspired by Dieter Rams&#39; &#39;ten principles of good design&#39;, we have put together our own set of principles that we believe are fundamental to successful map design.

_In [this folder](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/GeoDataViz-Toolkit/tree/master/Cartographic%20Design%20Principles) you will find our eight Design Principles and a handy checklist._
